## How do I approach designing software?
In this class I think my biggest lesson would be an enhanced attention to detail. When working with such small data points to ensure you have somewhere you need to be, it can be frustrating. With that said, this class has taught me (again) the fundamentals
of stayihg at a consistent rhythm while maintaining a productive output. Essentially, don't move to slow and delay things, but also slow down as to not delay things. This can of course not only be applied to programming or engineering, but anywhere. I think
we all sometimes can get into a rhythm, and then were suddenly smacked with a lime green tapered cylinder outside of the field of view.

## How do i approach developing programs
This class has taught me the value of planning more than most other classes. Other classes we work on various diagrams to better understand what exactly the application has, and needs. This class sets you down with a blank model and told me, 'Build a plane'.
And so I did, I knew what I wanted, I knew the shapes I wanted to use, and it was time to implement. But you can't just slap a model together without an idea or instructions. For me, the plane body was the anchor, and everything else was meant to fall in 
line. It seemed as though it was just a constant approach of strategizing the next shape, location, color etc. This section alone allowed me to truly envision a concept, such as the model I built, and piece it together slowly one-by-one.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals
As much fun as it was building a model, creating 3D models isn't what I walked away with in this class. Don't get me wrong, I understand it, it's a fun skill. But I don't believe that's what is important to me. Computational Graphics and Visualizations
provided me with a much stronger foundation in terms of the above mentioned traits. This will of course strengthen my coding, understanding, and creative sides without a doubt. However, those traits are what I am carrying out of this course the most.
